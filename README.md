<div align="justify" >
<p >Risk factor is an analysis that allows us to better understand how the output we are studying is impacted by the inputs. Although it is canonically to be used in health contexts in which the output is developing a disease such as lung cancer and one of the possible inputs is whether the individual smoke or not, it can be very useful. in data science environments to model several processes.</p>

<!-- <div align="justify" >
<p >Basically, if we want to calculate a simple risk factor, we just need to divide the total amount in the input by the total amount in the output.
In the previous example, we would have:</p>

![\Large x=\frac{number of individuals }}{number of individuals diagnosed with lung cancer}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})
